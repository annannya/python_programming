Reduce a string of lowercase characters in range ascii[‘a’..’z’]by doing a series of operations. In each operation, select a pair of adjacent letters that match, and delete them.

Delete as many characters as possible using this method and return the resulting string. If the final string is empty, return Empty String

n=input()  # strings are immutable
l=list(n)  # is liye hum string ko hum list convert kr dere h
i=0
while i<len(l)-1: # humne lenth - 1 is liye liya qki hum niche i+1 tk check kre h or i=5 hota to i+1 6 hojayega to out off scope chla jayega
    if l[i]==l[i+1]:
        del l[i] #python m code line by line interpretate hota h to jb ye line chla to agr list 10 ele ka hoga to vo del hone k bad 9 ka hogaya
        del l[i] # or jb ye line chla to auto matically vo i+1 vala hi ele ko delete kiya
        i=0
        if l==[]: # empty hoga to aaise hi indicate krna
            print("empty")
            break
    else:
        i=i+1
j=''.join(l)
print(j)
