#create a higher order function which will give three outputs 
# 1- it will return the sum of all even numbers
# 2- it will return the sum of all the odd numbers
# 3- it will return sum of all the numbers which are devisible by 3

# 1st we'll create a fx which will accept fx a and a list 
# then we'll create 3 lambda functions with all the 3 conditions
